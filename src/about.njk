        <p class="mission-text">VicAI was founded on the belief that artificial intelligence will shape every industry, every discipline, and every community. We exist to ensure students across Victoria University of Wellington — whether studying computer science, law, design, or te reo Maori — have the opportunity to understand, build with, and think critically about AI.</p>
        <p class="mission-text">We're based at Kelburn Campus in Poneke (Wellington), Aotearoa New Zealand. Our community includes undergraduates, postgraduates, and academic advisors from the School of Engineering and Computer Science, the School of Mathematics and Statistics, and beyond.</p>

    <h2 class="section__title">Background & Purpose</h2>
    <p>VicAI brings together curious and passionate people from diverse backgrounds into a community that collaborates on AI for a better future. What defines us is our culture of openness — from first lines of code to working alongside industry, we share the same drive to build together and help each other grow.</p>
    <p>Wellington's tech ecosystem is thriving. Companies like Xero, TradeMe, and Soul Machines were born here. The government is actively adopting AI across public services. We believe students should be at the table — not just as future employees, but as critical thinkers shaping how AI is used in Aotearoa.</p>
    <p>Our work is structured into five teams: Labs, Education, Events, Outreach & Diversity, and Safety & Governance. Each team contributes in a unique way — from running research projects and workshops to leading ethical discussions, community engagement, and mentorship initiatives.</p>
    <p>We take seriously the responsibility of working with AI in the context of Aotearoa. This includes engaging with questions of Maori data sovereignty, indigenous perspectives on technology, and ensuring AI development reflects the values of Te Tiriti o Waitangi.</p>

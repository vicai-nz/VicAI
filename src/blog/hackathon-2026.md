We're running our first ever hackathon, and we want you there.

## The details

- **When:** April 12-13, 2026 (Saturday-Sunday)
- **Where:** The Hub, Kelburn Campus
- **Teams:** 2-4 people (we'll help you find a team if you don't have one)
- **Cost:** Free. Food and drinks provided.
- **Prizes:** Sponsored by our industry partners

## The theme: AI for Aotearoa

We're not interested in generic chatbot demos. We want projects that address real problems in Aotearoa New Zealand.

Some directions to consider:

- **Te reo Maori language technology** — tools that support and revitalise te reo
- **Environmental monitoring** — AI for conservation, biosecurity, or climate adaptation
- **Public service delivery** — making government services more accessible and fair
- **Healthcare access** — supporting rural and underserved communities
- **Education** — tools that help New Zealand students learn

You're free to interpret the theme broadly. The only requirement is that your project should be built with New Zealand in mind.

## Who should enter

Everyone. Seriously.

You don't need to be a CS student. You don't need to know machine learning. The best hackathon teams have a mix of skills — coders, designers, writers, domain experts, and people who are good at asking the right questions.

If you've never been to a hackathon before, this is a great first one. We'll have mentors on hand throughout the weekend, and we'll run a quick "hackathon 101" session at the start.

## What we're looking for

Judging will be based on:

1. **Impact** — Does this solve a real problem for real people in NZ?
2. **Creativity** — Is the approach original and thoughtful?
3. **Execution** — Does the prototype work? Is it well-presented?
4. **Responsibility** — Have the team considered potential risks, biases, or ethical issues?

Note that we specifically include "responsibility" as a judging criterion. We believe building responsibly is part of building well.

## Register

Registrations are open now. [Sign up on our events page](/events/) or [join VicAI](/join/) if you haven't already.

See you in April.

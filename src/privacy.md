### About this policy

At the Victoria Artificial Intelligence Society ('VicAI', 'We', 'Us', 'Our'), we take our privacy obligations seriously. We comply with the Privacy Act 2020 when dealing with personal information. Personal information is information about an identifiable individual (a natural person).

This Privacy Policy explains how we will collect, use, disclose and store your personal information, and how you can exercise your rights in relation to your personal information.

We may need to update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The most recent version will be published on our website. The change will apply from the date we upload the updated policy.

This policy was last updated on **8 February 2026**.

### What personal information we collect

We collect personal information about you. This may include your:

(a) Name.

(b) Contact details, such as your email address and phone number.

(c) Student ID number.

(d) Programme of study and year of study.

(e) Photos and/or images in any video footage taken at club events.

(f) Personal opinions or feedback you provide on our activities and events.

---

### Who we collect your personal information from

We collect your personal information directly from you, where this is possible and practicable — usually when you join VicAI or register for an event.

We may also collect your personal information:

(a) from someone else, where you have authorised this;

(b) from publicly available sources;

(c) automatically, when you visit our website, such as your IP address and web pages you viewed. Some of this information may be collected using cookies and similar tracking technologies.

---

### Why we collect your personal information

We collect your personal information for the following purposes:

(a) to manage your membership of VicAI;

(b) to communicate with you regarding club activities, events and opportunities;

(c) to verify your eligibility for membership (e.g. confirming enrolment at Te Herenga Waka — Victoria University of Wellington);

(d) to provide relevant information and updates about VicAI activities;

(e) to allocate and apply for club funding from the University;

(f) to improve our activities and events based on your feedback;

(g) to protect and/or enforce our legitimate interests and comply with applicable laws;

(h) for any other purpose authorised by you or by the Privacy Act 2020.

If you do not provide us with some of the personal information we request, we may be unable to register you as a member or provide you with the full benefits of membership.

### Who we share your personal information with

There may be times where we need to share your personal information with third parties. We will only disclose your personal information to:

(a) Te Herenga Waka — Victoria University of Wellington, including the University Recreation Clubs Team, for the purposes of club registration, re-registration, funding allocation, and reporting. The University manages this information in accordance with its own [Privacy Notice](https://www.wgtn.ac.nz/site/privacy). Personalised member information is used for allocation of University funding to clubs. The University also reports on statistical information to the University community, but only after anonymising and aggregating the data first — no individual members will be identified. There are some other circumstances where the University may use or share personalised member information, for example responding to student health, safety or wellbeing events, as outlined in the University's Privacy Notice.

(b) Third-party event platforms (e.g. Eventbrite, Luma) used to manage event registrations.

(c) Third-party communication platforms (e.g. Discord, Slack, email services) used to communicate with members.

(d) Regulators, law enforcement bodies, government agencies, or other third parties where we consider it necessary to comply with applicable laws or regulations. Where possible and appropriate, we will notify you of this type of disclosure.

(e) Other people or organisations, where authorised by you.

We will not sell your personal information to anyone.

### How we store your personal information

We store your personal information securely using University-supplied tools such as SharePoint, or in password-protected files accessible only to the VicAI committee. Access to member information is limited to current committee members who need it for club administration purposes.

---

### How long we keep your personal information

We will keep your personal information for as long as is reasonably necessary for the purposes described in this policy — generally for the duration of your membership and for a reasonable period afterwards to meet any reporting or funding obligations. After this period, we will delete or anonymise your personal information.

---

### If you wish to access or correct your personal information

Subject to certain grounds for refusal set out in the Privacy Act 2020, you have the right to ask for a copy of the personal information we hold about you, and to ask for your personal information to be corrected if you think it is wrong.
